# Woodry_2024_Cortical-tuning-of-visual-memory
Code Repository for the Woodry, Curtis, &amp; Winawer (2024) preprint titled "Feedback scales the spatial tuning of cortical responses during visual memory"

paper/figures contains the code (both .ipynb notebooks and .py python markdown scripts) to generate the figures in the paper. It also contains a python script called "interstellar.py" which contains helper functions for the project, including functions for plotting the paper figures. 

Some of these functions in interstellar.py are old and no longer used, and many functions are coded exclusively for the purpose of this analyzing the data from this study. Therefore, the interstellar.py script is not meant to be a library for conducting similar analyses, but rather a repository of the code used for analysis and plotting the figures.

data/dataframes contains the processed data used for reproducing the figures.
